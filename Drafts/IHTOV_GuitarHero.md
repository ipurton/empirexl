In 2005 I attended the second annual Penny Arcade Expo in Belleue, Washington. Wandering the convention hall, I saw a Grim Reaper and aging British Invasion rocker duel it out to "Iron Man" at an arena dedicated to the forces of evil and the angelic. It was Guitar Hero and I was hooked.

Guitar Hero was released in 2XXX by Harmonix for the Playstation 2, a spiritual sequel to their more abstract rhythm games Frequency and Amplitude. All three games could by used with a bog standard PS2 controller, but their latest release (and a few extra $s) also allowed for a toy-like plastic guitar. Five candy bright buttons and a flickable strum bar clicky enough to be confused with a particularly niche mechanical keyboard. Hold a button and strum the bar with the right timing and electric fuzz would issue forth.
