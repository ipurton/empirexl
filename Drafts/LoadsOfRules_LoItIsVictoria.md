## What Is It?
"The rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious thing is to miss it. We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird. Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station? Chaos is dull; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or to Bagdad. **But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that he does say Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria.** No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride." - Syme, "The Man Who Was Thursday" by G.K. Chesterson

In 2020 I made a series of mixtapes, one each for a dear friend of mine. The last one I made was for myself and it was of only 2 without any real *theme*: the idea was just to select a bunch of songs meaningful to me that could also flow together. Less of a mixtape and more of a playlist, really.

Lacking a theme, the tape also lacks any real rules. Lacking any real rules, this post also lacks any real content. Lacking any real content, I have to fall back on the anecdotes that make these songs meaningful.

## Why Is It?

### Summer 1
One of my first exposures to classical music was the CD release of Vivaldi's Four Seasons, performed by the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. I'd heard music like this before but it was the first time I can remember controlling it: changing from track to track, pausing, absorbing, starting over... bringing the pieces into my head in a way I had never been able to before.

Max Richter I discovered much later in a route I can hardly remember, and his re-recording of Vivaldi's classic initially struck me as hubris in the extreme. His seeming ambivalence towards the original (discarding 75% of the original score) reinforced that, but actually listening to the work I found it less destructive than I originally feared. It's certainly different, maybe transformative, but I don't agree with the idea that it's a "post-modern" take on the original. I think of it more like a languid, expressive overview delivered by a learned expert unconcerned with reading from the script of sheet music: a living room performance delivered without much rehearsal or preperation (if only in sound and not in reality).

In some ways I feel this is how classical music should be dealt with: less a strict rehearsal and more celebratory and engaged. Closer to jazz performances of beloved standards and further from a trained lockstep symphony.

### Chateau Lobby #4

### No Rain
This is one of the first songs I ever thought of as an anthem: something that might play as a frame slid over my face in some imagined TV show version of my life.

### Mariners Apartment Complex
I remember enthusiastically discussing Lana Del Rey with two women in grad school around the time that "West Coast" came out; both were surprised that I didn't immediately dump all over her music like most everyone else did. I think I talked about how much I liked her music without going into the brief hyperfixation I had (which included tracking down bootlegs of her initial "Lizzie Grant" period).

I could have picked "West Coast", but NFR! was one of my favorite albums of 2019. I remember first hearing it when I visited a few close friends for the first time in months as the COVID lockdown slowly began to lift; it was after my first haircut in nearly a year and we sat on their deck, listening to Lana's unexpected cover of Sublime's "Doin' Time". I went and bought the album immediately.

### Even Cats Dream About Flying
In college, I took an intro to jazz class that required us to attend at least 2 live jazz concerts that quarter and return with a brief review of the performance. For both I attended shows from student jazz bands and at the end of the first a group came on with a stand-up bass, always an eye catcher. They performed this song and it immediately sounded familiar: not the way that a song you've heard before sounds familiar but in the way that a truly brilliant, beautiful classic song sounds familiar. No offense to them, but when I got home I immediately looked for the song name to find the original artist, discovering the Contemporary Noise Quintet (and their other permutations).
