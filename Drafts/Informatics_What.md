# What is informatics?

Pedantically, "informatics" comes from the portmaneau "Informatik", coined by Germans Karl Steinbuch and Helmut Gröttrup in 1956. The former would go on to write a paper, "Informatik: Automatische Informationsverarbeitung" (tl., "Informatics: Automatic Information Processing"). The word's struture led to it being understood as both Steinbuch's intended definition ("the practice of information processing") and a more general meaning of "the science of information."

The term has been gradually retooled and rescoped with time, going from a synonym of "computer science" to something more ethereal and semiotics-like. Some of those definitions are below (in order of my prefrences):

1. "The discipline of informatics makes connections between the work people do and technology that can support that work. It combines aspects of software engineering, human-computer interaction, decision theory, organizational behavior and information technology." ([Arizona State University, School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/))
2. "The study of the structure, behaviour, and interactions of natural and artificial computational systems." ([The University of Edinburgh, "What is Informatics?", 1994](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/what20is20informatics.pdf))
3. "Informatics is the study, design, and development of information technology for the good of people, organizations, and society." ([University of Washington Informatics Program](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics))
4. "Informatics is about intersections. It’s about using technology to solve problems by creating unique approaches and strategies to improve healthcare, battle poverty, protect the environment, and so much more." ([Indiana University Bloomington Department of Informatics](https://informatics.indiana.edu/)]

What should be clear from this (if not a meaning of the word) is how *new* this field really is. The consistency I see is the idea of informatics as a study of the metaphorical "space" between a user and an information system. This could be compared to psychology, where so much of the displine is devoted to researching and elaborating upon a concept or schema rather than a slice of physical reality (a microbioligist studying cell structures vs. a cognitive psychologist studying personalities). I also think of the idea of the gestalt and Plato's "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts": informatics is not interesting simply because of the user and system that is its unit of focus, but because of the emergent complexity of their interactions.

## Who is an informaticist?

The above is all well and good, but it doesn't really capture what informatics *does* (which is ironic since so much of the day to day of being an informaticist is figuring out what people ("users") want to do).

In the same way that every child is a "junior scientist" because of how they interact with nature, I think every troubleshooter, programmer, script kiddo, HTML-wiz, Excel expert, database admin, or all-in-all "tech person" is a "junior informaticist." In my experience, **the goal of an informaticist is to relate what someone wants to do with what a system can and should do**. Or to put it more complexily, to translate a user's (or user community's) functional requirements into posible technical configurations of one or more information systems and to then select and implement the "best" of those possibilities.

This requires that special mindset of someone who spends several hours figuring out how "VLOOKUP" works. The kind of person who encounters a sync issue in OneDrive and spends days or weeks researching alternatives in a frustrated, irritable haze. The person who figures out how to bind macros to their keyboard to get a leg up on their MOBA competition or, similarly, their fightstick to beat someone at Street Fighter 6. So maybe label it as a synonym of "nerd" and move on?

Its that mindset of thinking about how you want a system to work and what would be needed to make it work that way that's the foundation, I feel (Or: thinking about how a system should work and transforming what it does vs. operating within the bounds of the system/application without imagining alternatives). This can definitely be taught: it's about not being afraid or even respectful of the technology we use and recognizing that these are all *tools*. Barring laws and corporate policies (or fiscal limitations), you can do whatever you want with a computer. Tear it apart, install a new OS, write new programs and applications, mod video games to pornographic hubs... the possibilities are near-limitless.

To expand on what I said above then... an informaticist's goal is to explore and expand upon an information system's capabilities and the needs of that system's users to better satisfy the latter. I think "explore" is a key word there, but I'm also not totally happy with the definition.

## What's your point?

I'm hoping to use this space to explore what an "informaticist" is (among other things). This is mostly because I've been doing the job for over 2 years without really knowing what that job is, exactly.
