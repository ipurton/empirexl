Who *is* a villain, anyway? A villain is a different kind of character than a criminal, a crook, a thief, an antagonist, or another individual of ill repute. It’s a personality type: a constellation of characteristics organized away from whatever good fellow a story might include. 

From what I can tell listening to this mix, my definition of a villain is wrapped up in impulses. THe lack of a “conscience”: some nagging voice that restricts impulsive action. An individual who “does not have the affective of cognitive equipment for [moral or quasimoral ideals]” (Shapiro). More fully described: “[The psychopath] acts on whim, his aim is the quick, concrete gain, and his interests and talents are in ways and means” (Ibid). The hero is concerned about others but the villain is only ever concerned about themselves. Even when others enter into their calculus, it’s only ever in the villain’s context. Never “I need to help this person,” and always, “I need to help this person so that they will help me.” Aid is always conditional, the deal is always uneven, and the conditions are never set in stone.

Is this everyone’s definition? I doubt it. Wanting as I do to imagine myself as never the villain, and lacking any capacity for impulse, I think I’m guilty of a bit of projection on this point. It’s what makes the villain attractive and what allows me to keep them separate: the knowledge that I’ll never act like that coupled with the desire to do so.

Because who are the members of the rogues gallery I’ve gathered here? We have Gloria and Scarlett, a redressed, Depressive Hades

Gloria, Scarlett, Hades, Cowboy Dan, Kevin, the man in Shiola’s life, the Devil’s acolyte, the Captain, a Fury, Vide Noir, Black Crow, the Pirate.
